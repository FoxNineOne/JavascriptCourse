You should always plan your app first. 
So far, I sometimes do this.


// 1. User Stories

A user story is a description of an applications functionality from the user's persepctive
All user stories put together will descible the entire application.
        \/

// 2. Features

        \/

//3. Flow Charts - shows WHAT we will build


        \/

// 4. Architecture - HOW we will organise our code, what js features to use.
Gives us a structure in how we'll build functionality.

        \/

// DEVELOPMENT STEP - Implementation of our plan using code.
