Coding Challenge #1
Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners
about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For
now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy.
A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years
old.*/

Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:  */
